# Implementation Plan: 2026-10-20 seven-agent code audit fixes

**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Date:** 2026-10-20
**Approved by:** Parthiban, 2026-10-20: "Dee fic everything dude I need zero defects zero errors dude"

Source: the seven parallel read-only audits of 2026-10-20 (Rust-only sweep, hot
path, storage and audit, hostile review of the last 8 commits, zero-tick-loss and
reconnect paths, build run, branch check). One PR per lettered group, serially
(pr-completion-protocol.md).

Crates touched across the plan: `tickvault-app` (crates/app), `tickvault-storage`
(crates/storage), `tickvault-common` (crates/common/tests guards), `tickvault-trading`
(crates/trading, risk only; indicator/ and strategy/ need their own §28 approval).

## Plan Items

### PR A — depth rows the WAL refused never wait past 500 ms, plus backup-dedup allocation proof (app)

- [x] A1. Hand off unbacked depth rows from the frame arm when they have waited
  `FLUSH_INTERVAL`, so a saturated ring (biased select, timer arm not polled)
  cannot hold them in RAM for seconds. O(1) per frame.

    the_late_depth_paths_use_the_late_trigger_and_the_live_drain_does_not
- [x] A2. DHAT test that installs a backup set and runs two-socket duplicate
  traffic through every dedup arm under the production recorder.

  - Tests: dhat_backup_dedup_admits_and_drops_without_allocating

### PR B — frame ring allocation under backlog (app, hot path)

- [x] B1. (merged #2110) Replace the frame ring's growable block list with a pre-allocated
  bounded queue plus a wake, so a backlog never allocates on the socket reader.
  Design reviewed by hot-path, security and hostile agents before code.

    crates/core/Cargo.toml, crates/core/src/websocket/pool_supervisor.rs,
    crates/app/src/dhan_feed_stack.rs
  - Design (agent-reviewed 2026-10-20): `crossbeam_channel::bounded` storage
    (already a pinned workspace dep; all slots allocated at boot) plus a
    `tokio::sync::Notify` wake; strong-sender count for the close, so the
    drain still ends when every socket is gone; `recv` wrapped in
    `tokio::task::coop::cooperative` so a backlog still yields like tokio's
    channel; register (`Notified::enable`) before checking the queue, so no
    wake is lost.

### PR C0 — WAL apply-lag latch releases on a staircase drain (storage) — live disk risk

Found by the 2026-10-20 live AWS check (read-only): on 14, 15 and 16 Oct the
after-close depth pass wrote 0 rows and cleared 0 buckets (stop: Deadline)
while pinned WAL depth segments grew 74.6 → 118.1 GB against an 80.5 GB
ceiling. The pass pauses on the apply-lag latch; `market_depth` drained its
backlog 12 txn at a time with flat polls between, and the latch reset its
fall count on every flat poll, so it never released from late morning to
17:15. Operator chose "Pass ignores steady lag (Recommended)" on 2026-10-20.

- [x] C0. A flat poll neither counts as a fall nor resets the fall count; only a
  rise does. Jitter still never releases; a table stuck flat still latches.
  - Files: crates/storage/src/wal_suspension_watcher.rs
  - Tests: a_staircase_drain_with_flat_polls_releases_the_latch,
    a_re_arm_after_a_release_needs_two_fresh_falls,
    falls_before_the_latch_fires_do_not_count_toward_its_release,
    two_falls_an_hour_apart_do_not_release_the_latch,
    a_slow_staircase_stays_latched_instead_of_sawtoothing,
    a_rise_between_two_falls_keeps_the_latch_even_with_flat_polls,
    one_falling_poll_does_not_release_the_latch_but_two_do,
    a_lag_pinned_perfectly_flat_above_the_floor_still_latches,
    an_uneven_staircase_re_arms_but_pages_at_most_once_an_hour,
    a_new_episode_after_the_floor_pages_at_once,
    test_untrusted_count_holds_a_staircase_release_for_the_watermark
  - Proof: the two staircase tests FAIL on the old rule; the four hostile-review
    tests FAIL on the first version of this change (a fall count left stale
    after a fire or release, and no expiry for an old fall); all pass now.
    A second review found re-arm pages every 8-11 polls on uneven steps and the
    watermark trusting a staircase release: pages now wait an hour inside one
    episode, and the watermark keeps the old two-falls-in-a-row rule.

### PR C — top_volume spill replay window (storage)

- [ ] C1. A spilled hour is set aside by the age of its END and gets a second
  evening; an unparseable spill name no longer holds every partition's archive.
  - Files: crates/storage/src/tick_spill_replay.rs, crates/storage/src/partition_archive.rs
  - Tests: test_top_volume_spill_age_is_measured_from_the_hour_end,
    test_unparseable_spill_name_does_not_hold_every_partition

### PR D — guards and docs (common tests, trading risk, docs)

- [ ] D1. Shell budget covers compose CMD-SHELL healthchecks and systemd units outside deploy/systemd.
  - Files: crates/common/tests/shell_budget_guard.rs
  - Tests: compose_healthchecks_are_budgeted, every_systemd_unit_is_scanned
- [ ] D2. Coded error on the tick-gap tracker emit; the code guard flags every production `error!` without `code =` (frozen §28 files allowlisted until their own approval).
  - Files: crates/trading/src/risk/tick_gap_tracker.rs, crates/common/tests/error_code_tag_guard.rs
  - Tests: every_production_error_carries_a_code
- [ ] D3. CLAUDE.md: O(1) table rows for the frame ring backlog and the silent-swap register; stale benchmark rows; `variables.tf` IOPS text.
  - Files: CLAUDE.md, deploy/aws/terraform/variables.tf
  - Tests: claude_md_codebase_map_guard

### Not in this plan (blocked by a rule, need their own dated quote)

- Frame-silence fast path to `act`: the scope lock REJECTs defaulting to `act`
  without a dated measured row (websocket-connection-scope-lock.md 2026-10-10).
- Uncoded `error!` in `indicator/engine.rs` and `strategy/hot_reload.rs`: §28 frozen area.

## Design

PR A: a tiny clock (`UnbackedDepthClock`, Option<tokio Instant>) owned by the
drain. Each frame arm pass reads `has_unbacked_pending()` (one bool). While false
the clock is cleared; while true it starts once, and when `FLUSH_INTERVAL` has
passed the frame arm calls `flush_depth` and restarts it. The timer arm keeps its
own 500 ms check, so whichever arm runs first hands the rows on. No new task, no
lock, no allocation.

## Edge Cases

- No depth sink: `is_some_and` gives false; nothing changes.
- Flush fails or the offload queue is full: the writer keeps the flag; the clock
  restarts, so the next attempt is 500 ms later, never once per frame.
- Rows marked unbacked between flushes keep the oldest start.
- tokio Instant is monotonic; `saturating_duration_since` guards anyway.
- Ring idle: the timer arm still flushes at 500 ms as before.

## Failure Modes

- Extra flushes under load: at most one per 500 ms from the frame arm.
- A crash still loses unbacked rows inside the 500 ms window (unchanged, stated).

## Test Plan

Unit and property tests on the clock; the existing source assertion extended to
pin the frame-arm call; the new DHAT test; `cargo test -p tickvault-app --lib`,
`dhat_live_ingest_seam`, source size and scan budget guards, clippy, fmt.

## Rollback

Revert the PR: the frame arm loses the extra check; the timer arm's 500 ms flush
still runs whenever it is polled (the pre-PR behaviour).

## Observability

No new metric: depth flushes and drops are already counted by the writer and
`depth_dropped`. The fix shortens a window and adds no failure path.

## Guarantee matrix

Carries the 15-row + 7-row matrix by reference to
`.claude/rules/project/per-wave-guarantee-matrix.md`; per-PR specifics are in each
PR body.
