//! `index_constituency` persistence — the §31-item-2 full index→constituents
//! mapping, queryable from QuestDB.
//!
//! NTM Sub-PR "Map-A" (operator 2026-06-06 — "full per-index mapping … I need
//! guarantee and assurance"). Stores one row per `(trading_date, index_name,
//! security_id, exchange_segment)` so BOTH directions are answerable in SQL:
//!
//! ```sql
//! -- which stocks are in NIFTY BANK today?
//! SELECT symbol_name FROM index_constituency
//!   WHERE ts = today() AND index_name = 'Nifty Bank';
//! -- which indices is RELIANCE (sid 2885) in today?
//! SELECT index_name FROM index_constituency
//!   WHERE ts = today() AND security_id = 2885;
//! ```
//!
//! This is the MAP-ONLY surface (§31 item 2). It does NOT change the live
//! WebSocket subscription, which stays the NTM-union-only set (the 2-WS lock +
//! `MAX_DAILY_UNIVERSE_SIZE`). Boot wiring (fetch all ~46 lists → resolve
//! per-index → write here) lands in the companion "Map-B" PR; this PR ships the
//! self-contained, fully-tested persistence layer first.
//!
//! ## Schema invariants (mirrors the canonical `instrument_lifecycle` template)
//! * **Composite DEDUP** `(ts, index_name, security_id, exchange_segment, feed)`
//!   — I-P1-11 (Dhan reuses `security_id` across segments, so segment is
//!   mandatory) + `index_name` (a stock is in many indices) + `feed`
//!   (operator override 2026-06-28) + `ts`. The designated `ts` is PINNED to a
//!   CONSTANT epoch 0 ([`index_constituency_designated_ts_nanos`]) — exactly
//!   like `instrument_lifecycle` (`lifecycle_designated_ts_nanos() -> 0`,
//!   I-P1-08). QuestDB requires the designated `ts` in the DEDUP key, so we pin
//!   it to 0 and let the business key
//!   `(index_name, security_id, exchange_segment, feed)` do the deduplication.
//!   This is a CURRENT-STATE map (one row per (index, stock) per feed,
//!   overwritten in place each boot) — NOT per-day history. Pinning `ts`
//!   eliminates the cross-day duplicate accumulation (~742 rows/day) the
//!   previous day-floored `trading_date_ist` caused.
//! * Idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + `ALTER ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
//!   (schema self-heal — `observability-architecture.md`).
//! * ILP bulk ingest (port 9009) — the per-index mapping is large (~46 indices ×
//!   constituents, heavily overlapping → thousands of rows), so the `/exec` URL
//!   door would overflow; ILP is the real pipe.
//!
//! **Feature-gated** under `daily_universe_fetcher` per rule §21.
