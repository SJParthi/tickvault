# Groww Python SDK — Feed

> Faithful 1:1 capture for reference / Claude Code sessions.

The Groww Feed provides methods to subscribe to and receive Groww data streams and updates.

---

## Feed Client

Once you have your API key, you can use the `GrowwFeed` client to subscribe to live data streams and receive updates.

The Feed Client can either be used **synchronously** to get the last updated data or **asynchronously** to trigger a callback whenever new data is received.

To use the methods in Feed Client, you need an **exchange token** for the corresponding instrument. You can get the exchange token of a particular instrument from the instruments CSV file:
`https://growwapi-assets.groww.in/instruments/instrument.csv`

**You can subscribe for up to 1000 instruments at a time.**

---

## Feed Methods

The SDK provides methods to subscribe to and receive live data streams using the `GrowwFeed` class accessible from the `growwapi` module.

1. **Live Data:** Subscribe to, get, and unsubscribe from the live data of Derivatives, Stocks and Indices. Each supports subscribing, getting data and unsubscribing for multiple instruments in one go.
2. **Order updates** of Derivatives and Equity, and **Position updates** of Derivatives.

---

## Live Data

Subscribe and get the live data of equity, index and derivatives.

### Live Data for Equity and Derivatives

Subscribe to, get, and unsubscribe from the live data for equities or derivatives contracts.

```python
from growwapi import GrowwFeed, GrowwAPI

# Groww API Credentials (Replace with your actual credentials)
API_AUTH_TOKEN = "your_token"

groww = GrowwAPI(API_AUTH_TOKEN)
feed = GrowwFeed(groww)

def on_data_received(meta): # callback function which gets triggered when data is received
    print("Data received")
    print(feed.get_ltp())

# you can fetch exchange_token from instruments.csv file
instruments_list = [{"exchange": "NSE", "segment": "CASH", "exchange_token": "2885"}, {"exchange": "NSE", "segment": "FNO", "exchange_token": "35241"}]

feed.subscribe_ltp(instruments_list, on_data_received=on_data_received)

 # This is a blocking call. Nothing after this will run.
feed.consume()

# OR

# you can also fetch data synchronously
feed.subscribe_ltp(instruments_list)

# live data can also be continuously polled using this method
for i in range(10):
  time.sleep(3)
  print(feed.get_ltp())

feed.unsubscribe_ltp(instruments_list)
```

## Metadata

Metadata refers to additional information about the feed data, such as the exchange, segment, feed type, and feed key. This metadata is useful for identifying and categorizing the data received from the Groww Feed.

### Metadata Fields

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| exchange | str | Stock Exchange |
| segment | str | Segment of the instrument such as CASH, FNO etc. |
| feed_type | str | The type of feed data (e.g., ltp, order_updates, position_updates). |
| feed_key (Exchange token) | str | A unique identifier for the feed topic. |

### Example Metadata Usage

The metadata is passed to the callback function when data is received. You can use it to filter or process the data based on its attributes.

```python
def on_data_received(meta):
  print("Metadata received:")
  print(meta)
  # ....
```
